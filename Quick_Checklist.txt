   - Stock firmware (download .chk file)
   - ISP settings (PPPoE login, etc.)
   - DD-WRT settings (if already running DD-WRT)
3. Download correct "factory-to-ddwrt.chk" file.
4. Verify CFE (optional).
5. Full Factory Reset (30/30/30 reset).
6. Clear browser cache.
7. Use wired Ethernet connection only.
8. Flash factory-to-ddwrt.chk via Netgear web UI.

10. 30/30/30 reset again after flash.
11. Set new DD-WRT login credentials.
12. Save settings and reboot.

--- If Flash Fails (Recovery via TFTP) ---
1. Set static IP: 192.168.1.10 / 255.255.255.0 / Gateway 192.168.1.1
2. Download stock Netgear firmware (.chk file).
3. Prepare router: power off, hold reset, power on, hold 30+ sec.
4. TFTP firmware upload:
   - Command example: tftp -i 192.168.1.1 put firmware.chk
5. Wait patiently for reboot (5+ minutes).
6. Retry DD-WRT flashing once back on stock firmware.

Notes:
- Timing is critical during TFTP.
- Disable firewall/antivirus temporarily during recovery if needed.
